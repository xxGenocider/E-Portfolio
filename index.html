        <h2>Basics of Counting</h2>
        <p>
          This topic from the first part of CMSC57 was really a good foundation for me. It simply lived up to its name being ‘basic’ because it became a great platform for me to explore and learn before I dive in to deeper topics about combination and permutation. The module explained the topic well and I realized its significance to my major right away. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          I knew Math was going to play a big part in my college life because of the major I chose. Nonetheless, I did not think that it relates to Computer Science even to its very basics. I guess it really proves that Math is our universal language. Counting is something that is taught to us at a very young age. It was important for a child to learn how to count at least until ten before entering kindergarten. It was important because they will learn more complex process in arithmetic along the way. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Learning the basics of counting is kind of similar to that. You may think it’s useless or easy but this kind of counting is like a higher level of some sort. Just like the example about the shirt and its type, normally, we would count the shirts by division before we know its quantity. We were not aware that we can compute that using the knowledge of how many were made in a certain color or style. That just made the process a whole lot faster and easier, something very convenient for everyone. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, the whole process of understanding this topic wouldn’t be as easy if not because of the comprehensive module provided. Reading the module gave me the whole visual of the core lesson I needed to remember for the upcoming topics. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Pigeonhole Principle</h2>
        <p>
          The second topic on unit one was something new to me. I never heard of the pigeonhole principle before but it sure was interesting. The way it was explained in the module with pictures was a really big help in visualizing the whole concept of the principle. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          It might be a bit mind boggling thinking about how the pigeonhole principle could be useful in real life scenarios but it’s fairly simple if you think about it hard enough actually. Imagine working in a company with parking spaces provided for each employee. If there are 30 employees and 20 parking spaces, it wouldn’t be enough. You might say all 30 employees might not have their own vehicles but what if they did? You’ll never know until they actually bring one, it’s better to prepare for it instead of having to remodel you parking area in the future. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          One other simpler example is having to take out a pair of socks in the dark. I know you could just turn on the light but still, instances like these happen more often than you think. Grabbing three socks will make sure that you have the pair you want among two colors of socks. It’s really not that complicated. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Answering the problem set of this topic was a lot of fun. I had to think about literal pigeonholes to understand the scenarios given and I could say it worked well. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Generalized Permutation and Combination</h2>
        <p>
          This topic is where my learning about permutation and combination are being more realized. This time, repetitions are allowed. Indeed, there are counting problems where an element could or should be used repeatedly. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          The example I would always remember was the one about the fruits from a bowl with apples, oranges, and pears. If there are at least four pieces of each type of fruit in the bowl, there are indeed a lot of ways that you can select these fruits. It sounded really confusing to me at first but in the module, the possible combinations were listed and it made me understand the whole concept easier than I would originally have. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          The bars and stars method were also an amazing and new concept to me. It really made sense especially when it was shown on the problem about the different bills. When I did this on my own later on for the problem set, it made a lot more sense. It’s as if I’m seeing the possible combinations just by visualizing the scenario. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Permutations and combinations are topics that are subtly present in our lives. We may not notice them directly but we surely practice them in more ways than one. <br><br>

        <h2>Algebraic Structures</h2>
        <p>
          The second unit of this subject was a bit more challenging than the first one. Probability is not really my cup of tea although I understand how big of a role it plays in my major. Programming usually relies on probability values that we compute using the data we have gathered so understanding this topic is really important to me. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Personally, the first part of the module for algebraic structures did not make so much sense to me. The operation part was kind of confusing but I guess rereading the module and really studying it helped me a little. The YouTube links provided for binary operations was really useful as well. It helped that these terms were familiar to me since I remember it being discussed when I was in elementary school. The terms were familiar and the concepts are similar too. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Having to understand the use of mod and its congruence was also something very helpful to me. These are terms we usually encounter when programming especially when dealing with integers. Algebraic structure is studied because of the idea it gives on programming structures as well. Understanding the concepts in this topic helps us see more of the big picture when coding. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Groups, Rings, and Fields</h2>
        <p>
          This next topic in the second unit was kind of confusing at first. The concept was a lot to take in and the module was challenging but I guess I also got the hang of it eventually. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          For this topic, the recorded lecture provided was a lot of help. The group concept was explained more in the video lecture. I kind of had a hard time understanding what it meant by having identities or being associative. I couldn’t really tell the difference, but the lecture proved to be a lot of help. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          The characteristics provided for each category also helped a lot in determining if these structures are present in a group or given set. I found it to be really useful when answering the problem set. The clock arithmetic in the first part was the most relatable concept to me. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          I understand how military time works and could easily convert it to normal type whenever I get asked by someone who isn’t. I guess that was mainly why I understood it so quickly when reading the module provided. It was something I was really familiar with since we use clocks everyday or at least digital ones because of our world progress. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Expected Value and Variance</h2>
        <p>
          This topic was like a crossover with Statistics. I only ever did variance and standard deviation in Statistics. I guess that was why doing it with probability involved was a bit difficult than usual. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s easy to apply expected value and variance in real life. From the module, it was stated that we could use this topic to determine who has the upper hand in gambling games like mahjong and poker, or just computing average algorithms. The example about the die explained a lot for me. It showed how expected value could be calculated depending on conditions that are present. Just like when the die isn’t fair and has a number that appears twice as others, then the solution would be different. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          The coin was especially confusing to me. I listed the possible outcomes more than I should just to be sure of my solutions and answers. It’s a really good nothing that so many examples were provided in the module. Most of these samples were in the problem set as well so it gave me so much training ground for more complex assessments. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          The concept of Bernoulli Trials was the part that made the most sense to me. It was straight forward. Simply just a success or a failure. Having to follow its given formula is easy enough, you just have to identify your values accurately. This concept is useful to important data that we study in significant fields like medicine and finance. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Shortest Path Problems</h2>
        <p>
          This is one of the topics I enjoyed the most in this course. It is quite easy but at the same time challenging. The study guide also supplies useful real-life applications of the topic. This topic teaches you how to figure out the shortest path based on a graph. The graph has the nodes (location) and the edges (path) with their weight (assigned value). <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          One algorithm was introduced in this topic, the Dijkstra algorithm. The algorithm is the most used in solving shortest path problems. One of the important features of the Dijkstra algorithm is its efficiency. The algorithm is very efficient in terms of the number of comparisons that it makes. Additionally, the algorithm is also very fast in terms of the time required to sort the sequence. Consequently, the Dijkstra algorithm is widely used in real-world applications. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          I encountered a lot of coding problems that deal with the shortest path in some websites (e.g., leetcodes, code wars). Looking at the solution back then, I understand nothing. It looks complex and hard to digest. However, these topic makes me understand those solutions because most of them use the Dijkstra Algorithm. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Connectivity</h2>
        <p>
          This topic teaches how to figure out if a graph is strongly connected or weakly connected. The graph is said to be strongly connected if there is a path between a and b. The graph is said to be weakly connected if there is an undirected path between vertices in an undirected graph. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          This topic is an important tool that can be used in a variety of different applications. For example, connectivity is often used to determine the coordination of activities in a large, distributed system. In a large system, it is important to determine which tasks need to be coordinated in order to ensure that they are completed in a timely manner. Connectivity also plays a role in the communication between components in a system. By understanding the connectivity of a system, we can better understand the interactions between its individual elements. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Euler and Hamilton Paths</h2>
        <p>
          I find this topic interesting and the most challenging out of all topics dealing with graphs. Eulerian paths and circuit deals with edges while Hamilton paths and circuit deals with vertices. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          In graph theory, the Euler path (Eulerian trail) is a shortest path between two vertices in a connected Graph. The Euler path can be computed by following an edge only once and does not intersect any other edges along the way. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Euler cycle is similar to Euler path, but the difference is that for a network to be called a Eulerian (Eulerian cycle) it needs to start and end in the same vertex and use all the edges once. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Hamiltonian paths are paths that visits every vertex in a network exactly once. This is useful knowledge when planning for a trip. You can use Hamiltonian path to determine the path you take to visits all the places you want efficiently. <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
          Hamiltonian cycle is similar to Hamiltonian paths. However, in Hamiltonian cycle, you must start and ends in the same vertex. <br><br>
